# TherapEase - Making Therapy Easier.

Therapists can use this tool to monitor a live therapy session (virtual or in person).
Therapease will listen to your session in real-time, transcribe the conversation, and highlight relevant topics.
Therapists can see a real-time dashboard highlighting the revelevant topics covered.
As the subject of conversation changes, the new topics and entitites discussed popup, so you can keep track of important topics.
You can download a summary of session notes relevant to each topic and entity and the entire transcipt of the session.

TherapEase uses a Python backend and HTML/JavaScript frontend.
The Python backend is built with the FastAPI framework.
The backend calls out to several AI models including:
- Deepgram for streaming audio transcription and speaker diarization
- OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5-turbo for entity and topic modeling, summarization, and extraction
Deepgram streams back audio transcriptions in chunks. The backend accumulates the chunks and sends them in batches to GPT-3.5-turbo.
The backend streams results from the transcription and language model back to the client using an event-stream.
The client renders the results in the user interface.

To run this project create a virtual environment by running the below commands. You can learn more about setting up a virtual environment in this [article](https://developers.deepgram.com/blog/2022/02/python-virtual-environments/). 

```
mkdir [% NAME_OF_YOUR_DIRECTORY %]
cd [% NAME_OF_YOUR_DIRECTORY %]
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure your virtual environment is activated and install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file inside. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you're in the directory with the **main.py** file and run the project in the development server.

```
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

Pull up a browser and go to your localhost, http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Allow access to your microphone and start speaking. A transcript of your audio will appear in the browser.
