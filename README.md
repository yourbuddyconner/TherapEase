# Live Transcription With Python and FastAPI

To run this project create a virtual environment by running the below commands. You can learn more about setting up a virtual environment in this [article](https://developers.deepgram.com/blog/2022/02/python-virtual-environments/). 

```
mkdir [% NAME_OF_YOUR_DIRECTORY %]
cd [% NAME_OF_YOUR_DIRECTORY %]
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure your virtual environment is activated and install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file inside. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you're in the directory with the **main.py** file and run the project in the development server.

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Pull up a browser and go to your localhost, http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
